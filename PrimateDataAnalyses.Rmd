## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Primate Data Analyses

# Now that we have a clean, full dataset for our primate morphology and range of motion (ROM) data, we need to start analyzing the data to help us understand possible relationships between bone morphology and ROM.

# Look back at previous R Markdowns and DataCamp courses for help! And please ask me for help when you need it!


# 1. Import the full primate dataset from GitHub (PrimateMorphROMData_Full.csv):
```{r}
pri.dat <- read.csv(file.choose())
```


# 2. Descriptive statistics: Calculate the means and standard deviations (SD) for each morphology and ROM variable in your dataset. Assign each mean and SD to a new variable!
# Tip: Use the na.rm=TRUE argument in your funtions if dealing with NAs in your data. Ex: mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)
```{r}
mean.femurhead<- mean(pri.dat$FemurHead)
#23.00
mean.nsa <- mean(pri.dat$NSA, na.rm = TRUE)
#110.664
mean.neck <- mean(pri.dat$Neck, na.rm = TRUE)
#23.86931
mean.L2 <- mean(pri.dat$L2, na.rm = TRUE)
#195.9925
mean.L4 <- mean(pri.dat$L4, na.rm = TRUE)
#20.51806
mean.FTA <- mean(pri.dat$FTA, na.rm = TRUE)
#72.75
mean.PS <- mean(pri.dat$PS, na.rm = TRUE)
#314.21
mean.PI <- mean(pri.dat$PI, na.rm = TRUE)
#198.45
mean.AS <- mean(pri.dat$AS, na.rm = TRUE)
#334.72
mean.AI <- mean(pri.dat$AI, na.rm = TRUE)
#304
mean.tot <- mean(pri.dat$TotalArea, na.rm = TRUE)
#1257.79
mean.SUP <- mean(pri.dat$SUP, na.rm = TRUE)
#107.54
mean.ANT <- mean(pri.dat$ANT, na.rm = TRUE)
#100.5
mean.acet <- mean(pri.dat$AcetabDiameter, na.rm = TRUE)
#26.13
mean.pel <- mean(pri.dat$PelvicBreadth, na.rm = TRUE)
#49.31
mean.abd <- mean(pri.dat$Abduction, na.rm = TRUE)
#49.31
mean.abdk <- mean(pri.dat$AbductedKnee, na.rm = TRUE)
#215.3
```


# 3. Descriptive statistics: Calculate the means and standard deviations (SD) for each morphology and ROM variable by GENUS. For example, what is the mean Femur Head size for primates in the Alouatta genus?
# Tip: Remember the square brackets? []
```{r}
mean.fh_alouatta <- mean(pri.dat$FemurHead[1:10])
#14.6945
mean.fh_ateles <- mean(pri.dat$FemurHead[11:24])
#17.38543
mean.fh_cebus <- mean(pri.dat$FemurHead[25:33])
#10.46011
mean.fh_cercopithecus <- mean(pri.dat$FemurHead[34:41])
#14.10812
mean.fh_colobus <- mean(pri.dat$FemurHead[42:46])
#16.9088
```


# 4. Graphing: Create scatterplots (with the plots() function) with Abduction (an ROM variable) as the y variable (dependent variable) and morphology variables (Femur Head, NSA, Neck, etc.) as the x variable (independent variable). Make sure to include axis labels, titles, and appropriate colors.
```{r}

```


# 5. Using comments (#), label any of your scatterplots that you think show a relationship between Abduction and the morphology variable.


# 6. Graphing: Create scatterplots (with the plots() function) with Abducted Knee Position (an ROM variable) as the y variable (dependent variable) and morphology variables (Femur Head, NSA, Neck, etc.) as the x variable (independent variable). Make sure to include axis labels, titles, and appropriate colors.
```{r}

```


# 7. Using comments (#), label any of your scatterplots that you think show a relationship between Abduction and the morphology variable.


# 8. Create two boxplots side-by-side to compare the Abduction of all Suspensory and all Non-Suspensory primates (using the Locomotion variable)
# Tip: Remember the square brackets? []
```{r}

```


# 9. Create two boxplots side-by-side to compare the Abducted Knee Position of all Suspensory and all Non-Suspensory primates (using the Locomotion variable)
# Tip: Remember the square brackets? []
```{r}

```
