## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Plot of Primate ROM and Morphology Data

# Uploading Data
```{r}
rom.dat <- read.csv(file.choose())
morph.dat <- read.csv(file.choose())
```


# Installing package
```{r}
install.packages("car")
library(car)
```

#Creating Q-Q plot
```{r}
indexF <- which(rom.dat$Sex == "F")
qqPlot(indexF)
```


# Boxplot
```{r}
boxplot(Extension ~ Flexion, data = rom.dat, varwidth = TRUE, log = "y", las = 1)
title("Extension vs. Flexion")
```


# Side by Side plot
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(rom.dat$Extension, rom.dat$Flexion)
title("Exension vs Flexion")
plot(rom.dat$InternalRotation, rom.dat$ExternalRotation, log = "xy")
title("Internal vs External Rotation")
plot(rom.dat$Abduction, rom.dat$Adduction)
title("Abduction vs Adduction")
```


#Create a scatterplot with ‘Abduction’ as the y variable. Change the shapes and colors of the points to distinguish between different variables. Add an equality reference line (with abline() function).

```{r}
plot(rom.dat$ThighLength, rom.dat$Abduction, pch = 17, col = "red")
points(rom.dat$ThighLength, rom.dat$BiepicondylarBreadth, pch = 16, col = "blue")
abline(a = 0, b = 1, lty = 2)

```


```{r}
primate_data <- read.csv(file.choose())
```

#Create a scatterplot with ‘Abduction’ as the y variable and a morphology variable as the x variable. Add other morphology variables to the same plot (with points() function). Change the shapes and colors of the points to distinguish between different variables. Add an equality reference line (with abline() function).
```{r}
plot(primate_data$femur_head, primate_data$Abduction, pch = 17, col = "red")
points(primate_data$AS, primate_data$Abduction, pch = 16, col = "blue")
abline(a = 0, b = 1, lty = 2)

```

#Create at least one more scatterplot that compares an ROM variable to multiple morphology variables. Do you see any trends or correlations?

```{r}
plot(primate_data$NSA, primate_data$Abduction, pch = 17, col = "yellow")
points(primate_data$SUP, primate_data$Abduction, pch = 16, col = "purple")
abline(a = 0, b = 1, lty = 2)
```

#Last scatterplot!
```{r}
plot(primate_data$acetab_diameter, primate_data$Abduction, pch = 18, col = "green")
points(primate_data$PS, primate_data$Abduction, pch = 4, col = "orange")
abline(a = 0, b = 1, lty = 2)

```
