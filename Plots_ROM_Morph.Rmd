## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Plot of Primate ROM and Morphology Data

# Uploading Data
```{r}
rom.dat <- read.csv(file.choose())
morph.dat <- read.csv(file.choose())
```


# Installing package
```{r}
install.packages("car")
library(car)
```

#Creating Q-Q plot
```{r}
indexF <- which(rom.dat$Sex == "F")
qqPlot(indexF)
```


# Boxplot
```{r}
boxplot(Extension ~ Flexion, data = rom.dat, varwidth = TRUE, log = "y", las = 1)
title("Extension vs. Flexion")
```


# Side by Side plot
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(rom.dat$Extension, rom.dat$Flexion)
title("Exension vs Flexion")
plot(rom.dat$InternalRotation, rom.dat$ExternalRotation, log = "xy")
title("Internal vs External Rotation")
plot(rom.dat$Abduction, rom.dat$Adduction)
title("Abduction vs Adduction")
```


#Create a scatterplot with ‘Abduction’ as the y variable. Change the shapes and colors of the points to distinguish between different variables. Add an equality reference line (with abline() function).

```{r}
plot(rom.dat$ThighLength, rom.dat$Abduction, pch = 17, col = "red")
points(rom.dat$ThighLength, rom.dat$BiepicondylarBreadth, pch = 16, col = "blue")
abline(a = 0, b = 1, lty = 2)

```
